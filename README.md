# kadane_algorithm


Here is a kadane's algorithm using java.Do you know about this??? if no,their is no need to worry.
Kadane's algorithm is a Dynamic Programming approach to solve “the largest contiguous elements in an array” with runtime of O(n).
    Now,you think what is contiguous element in array???  
So,it is a subarray defined by any subset of the indices of the original array.
